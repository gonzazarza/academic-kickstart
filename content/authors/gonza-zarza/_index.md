## About me

I hold a doctoral degree in High-Performance Computing and co-authored the book ["Big Data Engineering, How to Deal with Data"](http://www.editorialuoc.cat/la-ingenieria-del-big-data).

I currently serve as Technical Director in the Data & Analytics, and the Artificial Intelligence Studios at Globant, with a strong emphasis on data engineering and strategy. At Globant, I lead the Data Architecture practice at a global scale, leading a team of more than 180 highly skilled professionals located in USA, Europe, India and Latin America.

[In the academic field](#teaching), I have lectured graduate and postgraduate courses at the Escola d'Enginyeria from the Universitat Aunònoma de Barcelona (UAB) for more than five years. Since 2016, I teach Data and Analytics in Masters degrees of the Business School at the Universidad Argentina de la Empresa (UADE). 

In addition, I frequently speak at [conferences and events](/talk) about Big Data, High-Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence.
