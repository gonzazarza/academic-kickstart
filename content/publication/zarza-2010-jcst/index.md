abstract: "The intensive and continuous use of high-performance computers for executing computationally intensive applications, coupled with the large number of elements that make them up, dramatically increase the likelihood of failures during their operation. As interconnection networks are critical parts of such systems, network faults have an extremely high impact because most routing algorithms are not designed to tolerate faults. In such algorithms, just a single fault may stall messages in the network, prevent the finalization of applications, or lead to deadlocked configurations. This work focuses on the problem of fault tolerance for high-speed interconnection networks from the design of a fault-tolerant routing method intended to treat a large number of dynamic faults (permanent and non-permanent). To accomplish this task our method takes advantage of communication path redundancy by means of a multipath routing approach. Experiments show that the method allows applications to finalize their execution in the presence of several faults, with an average performance value of 97% compared to the fault-free scenarios."
