abstract: "The intensive and continuous use of high-performance computers for executing computationally intensive applications, coupled with the large number of elements that make them up, dramatically increase the likelihood of failures during their operation. The interconnection network is a critical part of such systems, therefore, network faults have an extremely high impact because most routing algorithms are not designed to tolerate faults. In such algorithms, just a single fault may stall messages in the network, preventing the finalization of applications, or may lead to deadlocked configurations. This work focuses on the problem of fault tolerance for high-speed interconnection networks by designing a fault-tolerant routing method to solve an unbounded number of dynamic faults (permanent and non-permanent). To accomplish this task we take advantage of the communication path redundancy, by means of a multipath routing approach. Experiments show that our method allows applications to finalize their execution in the presence of several number of faults, with an average performance value of 97% compared to the fault-free scenarios."
