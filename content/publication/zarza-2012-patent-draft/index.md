abstract: "The method comprises: a) detecting a situation prone to a blockage; and b) identifying a routing cycle involved in the detected situation prone to a blockage by virtue of a router (r^i) carrying out the following substeps by means of an asynchronous intra-router and inter-router search mechanism which does not require the use of timers: b1) composing and sending an identification message from an input buffer (a^ij) of the router (r^i) to an output buffer (b^hk) of another router (r^h); and b2) receiving the identification message in the output buffer (bik) associated with said input buffer (a^ij) of the router (r^i) which composed said message, following the retransmission thereof by at least another router (r^h) from an input buffer (a^hj) thereof. The system and the router are adapted to implement the method proposed by the invention."
