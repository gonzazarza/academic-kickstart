abstract: "This work presents ClusterGUI; an application specialized in the submission and control of OPNET simulation jobs to the Oracle Grid Engine (previously known as Sun Grid Engine - SGE) Resource Manager, using the Distributed Resource Management Application API (DRMAA) libraries. With a Resource Manager acting as a middleware between cluster resources and simulation runs, traditional tools cannot be directly used to launch the simulations. With ClusterGUI we can send multiple simulations to a resource manager in a cluster in order to fully use available resources. We compare simulations results by launching many standalone runs against a resource-managed distributed approach, to perform parametric studies more quickly by launching simulations concurrently."
